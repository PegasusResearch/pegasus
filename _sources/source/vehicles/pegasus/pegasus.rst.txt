Pegasus Drone
=============

In this section, we describe the setup of the Pegasus 5" Prototype drone. Equipped with a KakuteH7 flight controller and an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano onboard computer, it enables the fast prototyping and testing of control algoritms with vision in dedicated flight arenas such as the :ref:`Taguspark Flight Arena` or outdoor flight.

History
-------

"The initial goal was to design a 3D printed drone that could be used for research and education in the field of control and robotics. Eventhough the first prototype worked, I never felt comfortable flying it near people due to the risk of a propeller breaking and causing injury. The most recent prototype was developed with a carbon fiber frame and 3D printed parts to be safer for flights near people. It is more expensive to make, but it is worth it for the added safety."
- Marcelo Jacinto

As such, now there are two models available:

* **Version 2 (2024-2025):** This version has a carbon fiber frame and 3D printed parts. It was developed to be safer for flights near people.

* **Version 1 (2023-2024):** This version has a full 3D printed frame without requiring any expensive carbon fiber parts. It was developed to be a low-cost platform for research and education.
