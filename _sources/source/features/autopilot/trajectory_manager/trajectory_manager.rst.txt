Trajectory Manager
==================

In this section, we explain how the define parametric paths or trajectories to be followed by the vehicle.


This page is structured as follows:

* Section :ref:`Mathematical Background` introduces the main mathematical concepts behind the trajectory manager.
* Section :ref:`Trajectory Interface` provides an overview of the interface that a trajectory must implement to be used by the trajectory manager.
* Section :ref:`Provided Trajectories` provides showcases the provided trajectories and where they are implemented.
* Section :ref:`Adding Custom Static Trajectories` provides a step-by-step guide on how to add custom trajectories to the trajectory manager.
