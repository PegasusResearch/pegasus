# Pegasus

**Pegasus** is a quasi open-source Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) software package for controlling autonomous drones using ROS 2. 
It is designed to be used with the PX4 flight stack, but open enough to be used with other flight stacks as well. It is mainly written in C++ and Python.

This work is part of the **Pegasus Project**, a semi-personal side project started by Marcelo Jacinto with the end-goal of supporting experimental validation of his Ph.D. It provides:

- A set of ROS 2 nodes with a modular state machine;

- A CAD model for a 3D printed drone used in the project;

- An interface with PX4 and Pegasus Simulator and Gazebo Classic for 3D simulations;

This project is provided as is, with no warranty or support. It is intended to be used as a reference for other researchers and developers in the field of control and robotics. It may **NOT**
be used for commercial purposes or military applications without the explicit consent from the project founder.

## Main Developer Team

This simulation framework is an open-source effort, started by me, Marcelo Jacinto in January/2023. It is a tool that was created with the original purpose of serving my Ph.D. workplan for the next 4 years, which means that you can expect this repository to be mantained, hopefully at least until 2027.
